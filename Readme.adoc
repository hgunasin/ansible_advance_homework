==== Ansible Advanced Homework

1. Create 2 Lab environments
  - OPENTLC Automation -> Ansible Advanced - Homework 
  - OPENTLC Automation -> Ansible Advanced - OpenStack

2. Copy and set the permissions of the /root/.ssh/mykey.pem file to 0400 and set the owner as root:root.

    laptop]# scp -i /home/<username>/.ssh/your-key.pem /home/<username>/.ssh/your-key.pem username-company.name@bastion.<GUID>.example.com:/tmp
    laptop]# ssh -i /home/<username>/.ssh/your-key.pem  username-company.name@bastion.<GUID>.example.com
    bastion]$  sudo -i
    bastion]# cp /tmp/<your-key.pem>  /root/.ssh/mykey.pem
    bastion]# chown root:root /root/.ssh/mykey.pem
    bastion]# chmod 0400 /root/.ssh/mykey.pem

3. Verify a successful connection to workstation-${OSP_GUID}.rhpds.opentlc.com using ~/.ssh/mykey.pem:

    bastion]# ssh -i /root/.ssh/mykey.pem <username-company.com>@workstation-${OSP_GUID}.rhpds.opentlc.com
    workstation]$ exit
    bastion]#

4. Fork the github repo 

    bastion]# git clone https://github.com/prasanna-holla/ansible_advance_homework
    bastion]# cd ansible_advance_homework

5. edit the environment_setup.sh for following variables

	TOWER_GUID=
	OSP_GUID=
	OPENTLC_LOGIN=prasanna.holla-in.ibm.com
	OPENTLC_PASSWORD=
	GITHUB_REPO=https://github.com/prasanna-holla/ansible_advance_homework
	RH_MAIL_ID=prasanna.holla@in.ibm.com

6. Run the environment_setup script to setup workstation, isolated node, OSP components and configure tower

   bastion]# bash environment_setup.sh 

7. Using following credentials log in to Ansible Tower nodes:

    URL	- https://tower(1-3).{{TOWER_GUID}}.example.opentlc.com
    Username - Admin
    Password - r3dh4t1!


8. In Tower UI, verify following
    a. In "Instance Groups" section, verify Isolated node with ensure "osp" entry exists.
    b. Under "Projects" section, verify "Homework Assignment" project exists
    c. Under "Templates" section, you can locate multiple entries. 

9. Execute "cicd_workflow" by clicking on rocket symbol. This should create QA & Prod environments, deploy 3-tier apps and test them.

10. In bastion server, run grading-script.yml playbook for verifying successful completion of the homework

    bastion]# export ANSIBLE_ADVANCE_GUID=<GUID of 3tier-lab created using order_svc.sh script>
    bastion]# export OSP_GUID=<osp guid>    
	bastion]# cd /root/ansible_advance_homework
    bastion]# ansible-playbook grading-script.yml -e OSP_GUID=${OSP_GUID} -e ANSIBLE_ADVANCE_GUID=${ANSIBLE_ADVANCE_GUID}
